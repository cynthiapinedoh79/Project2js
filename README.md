You can now access your project live on the web using the provided GitHub Pages URL.

### 🍴 Forking the GitHub Repository

  Forking a GitHub repository allows you to create a personal copy of the original project in your own GitHub account. This enables you to freely explore, modify, or contribute without affecting the original codebase. Follow these steps:

  1. Log in to GitHub and open the target [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/).
  2. At the top-right corner of the repository page (just above the "Settings" tab), click the **"Fork"** button.
  3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your own account.
  4. You can now freely edit, update, and experiment within your forked version without impacting the original repository.

### 📂 Making a Local Clone

  Follow these steps to create a local copy of the repository on your machine:
   
  1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the target [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/).
  2. Below the repository name, click the **"Code"** button (formerly "Clone or download").
  3. Under **"Clone with HTTPS"**, copy the provided URL.
  4. Open **Git Bash** (or your terminal of choice).
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned project to reside.
  6. Type the following command and paste the URL you copied in Step 3:
  
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

  7. Press Enter. Git will create a full local clone of the repository:
